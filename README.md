# Numerical-Calculus
This repository contains C++ implementations for numerical differentiation and integration techniques. It includes methods for forward, backward, and central differences for differentiation, and trapezoidal 
and Simpson's rule for integration. The project also features a simple console-based user interface for visualizing the functions and their derivatives or integrals.
